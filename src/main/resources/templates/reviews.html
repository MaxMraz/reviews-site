	<h1>All of Greg's Sweaters, Reviewed</h1>
</head>
	<main>
		<p>I've known Greg Bublinski since '79. And in that time I've seen his sweater collection grow like crabgrass after a May thunderstorm. He has a sweater to wear to the theme park, a sweater to wear while mowing the lawn, a sweater for ski trips. It's unreasonable. I've taken it upon myself to add some organization to this madness and give each of his sweaters a rating, so mankind can make some sense of this collection of apparel.</p>
