##A Review Site for All of Greg's Sweaters (does not yet include all of Greg's Sweaters)
A made a review site from the point of view of a man in 2004 who knows a little HTML and wanted to make a website to lightly make fun of his friend's sweater collection. However, in reading through it, you come to realize how deep their friendship actually runs.

Each Review Contains:
A photo of the sweater
The date the photo was taken
A rating and description of the sweater and its context
The category this sweater belongs to
A recommendation on whether or not to keep the sweater. The recommendation is always to keep it, because secretly, Greg's friend loves his sweater collection.
